**Seasonal Music** is a Forge mod that enhances your Minecraft experience by adding **season-based ambient music** and **new music discs**. It integrates with [Serene Seasons](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/SereneSeasons) to bring **music that changes with the seasons** provided by Serene seasons. 
More features are on the work, like biome based changes. weather based changes. But, those are still underwork. Currently the mod only playes the music once
during a change in season.
